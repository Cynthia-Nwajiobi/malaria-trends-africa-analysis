# Malaria Trends Analysis
## Project Overview
Malaria is still a significant public health issue till date, most especially in sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for the vast majority of global malaria cases and deaths, with over half a million deaths annually, mostly among children under five. 
This project aims to look through the malaria trends in Africa gotten from public datasets which cover malaria occurrence from 2007 to 2017. 
Through this analysis, we will see the progress made by some African countries and the countries still battling with high burdens.

### Objective
Analyse malaria trends across African countries.

Timeframe: 2007–2017

#### Key Questions:
How have malaria trends evolved?
Which countries succeeded in elimination?
Where is the burden still high?

### Methodology
Datasets were sourced from a Kaggle dataset aggregated from WHO.

A lot of columns were irrelevant to the analysis.

#### Actions taken:
- Cleaned missing/inconsistent values
- Created a pivot table on Excel
- Focused on confirmed cases by year and country
- Used Python for exploratory data analysis

*Tools Used: Excel, Python, Looker

### Findings & Insights
Between 2008 and 2017, Burkina Faso appeared to have one of the highest reported malaria cases and also had the highest malaria incidence rate, meaning that new cases were occurring rapidly within that period.

While Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, Mali, and Benin had the highest incidence rates on the continent, none of them were among the top 5 countries with the highest reported cases, indicating that the malaria incidence in these countries was handled critically.

### Limitations with the data
The goal was to work with datasets up till 2022 and to also find a correlation between several factors that could lead to the rate of malaria cases in high-burden and low-burden countries.

However, the data was limited in the sense that:
1. The dataset wasn’t up-to-date (only available until 2017)
2. The supposedly most important columns like antimalarial treatment and bed net usage, had a high number of missing values such that it’d be a risk to manipulate such values. 

### Recommendations
1. Strengthened surveillance in high-burden countries
2. Data standardization by health authorities
3. Focused interventions based on regional trends
4. Expand bed net distribution and malaria treatment access
5. Invest in creating sanitable communities as stagnant water and poor water drainage systems breed mosquitoes, which can lead to high malaria incidence in endemic regions.

### Conclusion
The fact that this analysis only covers 2007-2017 data, yet, 8 years later, the malaria burden for countries like Nigeria, Mozambique and DRC has only gotten worse. 
There is a need for serious policy intervention by government and stakeholders. Lack of sufficient data on the distribution of mosquito nets and antimalarial treatment shows that these factors are not being accounted for as they should. 
The successful elimination of malaria by countries like Algeria and Cabo Verde further proves that a malaria-free Africa is possible.
